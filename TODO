1. Documentation. 
      multiple apps in same cgi dir
      compilation of models for speed and code protection
      tricks
2. Hierarchial pages. Currently pages can be hierarchial but the control.scm 
   doesn't get called at the right time. 
3. For sqlite3 usage put session into own db?
4. A mechanism for sharing variables better between control and view
   would be good.
   Perhaps:
     (let ()
       (load control)
       (load view))
5. Change all the "included" files to be seperately compiled units
   and adj. makefile accordingly. This would speed up compilation
   when changes are isolated to one or two files.
6. The dbi interface needs a simple config mecanism alternative to
   the current list of pairs which is hard to use on the fly. 
   Something like the perl:
     "dbi:host:port:user:password"

I'm sure there is more ...
